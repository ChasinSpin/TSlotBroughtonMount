# T-Slot Paver Mount

The T-Slot Paver Mount is a fixed-position AltAz telescope mount designed primarily for pre-point asteroid occultations with smaller telescopes. It is similar to a tripod, but easier and more precise when adjusting. Better than 1-arcmin precision is easily achievable.

This mount is inspired by the original Paver Mount design of John Boughton and has similar dimensions.

## Features

* Low profile
* Parametric design in [OpenSCAD] (https://openscad.org). Can easily be adapted. 
* Full range (0-90 degrees in altitude - zenith works, won't tip over)
* Small and lightweight, ideal for air travel (can also be disassembled)
* Set up, remove, and place back in position days later
* Collapsable for transport (and can be put back to the previous AltAz position)
* Both coarse and fine adjustment for altitude and azimuth
* Rigid design
* Silver or black (black for stealth deployments)
* 2020 Aluminum T-Slot, using standard parts
* Easy to build (hacksaw, file, drill, 3D printed parts)
* Cost-effective
* Can be adjusted to better than 1-arcmin precision

## Supported Telescopes

Many small telescopes are supported, examples:

* Mighty Mini (IOTA) - (1/4-20 UNC standard tripod thread)
* Orion ST (Short Tube) 80mm
* Orion ST (Short Tube 120mm) - see [Extending For Larger Scopes](extending-for-larger-scopes)
* If the scope is larger, the design can be expanded, see [Extending For Larger Scopes](extending-for-larger-scopes)

## Printing 3D Parts

If you have a 3D filament printer, then you're good to go. It's also possible to order the parts printed for you via a 3D printing service. The parts are designed to be printed in PLA, but other materials can be used.

## Azimuth Adjustment

Coarse azimuth adjustments can be made by moving the mount.  Fine adjustments can be made with 2 fingers pushing against the 2 pieces of 2020 to displace the position and the thumbwheel can be used to tighten.

## Altitude Adjustment

Coarse altitude adjustments can be made by raising/lowering the altitude bar and tightening the knobs.  Fine adjustments can be made by using the screw in foot at the front of the mount.

## Collapsing For Transport

The mount can be completely collapsed for transport.  Additionally, if air travelling and a very minimal footprint is required, an allen key can be used to detach the cross bars for transport.

## Marking Settings For Later Deployment

For altitude, use a 0.4mm sharpie felt pen to make the position of both ends of the altitude bar on the aluminum.  To remove the marking later, any type of alcohol can be used to remove.

The altitude fine adjustment foot can be locked in place using the lock wheel provided.

For azimuth, use the graduated scale near the front of the mount, and note the position (or take a photo).

## Attaching Telescopes

Telescopes can be attached via a stretchable band 3d printed from NinjaFlex or TPU.  Also, just a length of TPU/NinjaFlex filament, thick rubber band or strong elastic can be used.

## High Altitudes near Zenith

Due to weight of the scope and possibility of tip over, for higher altitudes nearer to the zenith, the 4th leg should be extended to prevent tipover.

## Extending For Larger Scopes

The design is extendable within sensible limits for larger telescopes, by increasing the length of the 2020 extrusion in the same proportion for all parts.
