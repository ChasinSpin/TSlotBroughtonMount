# Assembly Guide

## Tools Required:

* Hobby Knife
* Hacksaw and Miter Box
* Drill Bit 5mm (ideally) or 13/64" (slightly larger)
* Drill
* Metal File or Coarse Belt Sander
* Coarse Sand Paper
* Superglue
* Pliers
* 3mm Allen Key

## Important Warnings: 
1. Fine aluminum dust/chips created by sanding, cutting, and filing can combust and be an explosion hazard when provided with an ignition source.  Clean the work area frequently and avoid ignition sources.

2. Wear protective eyewear/gear.

It's recommended that foam/felt or other materials are not used on the telescope saddles if the mount is intended to be used for "pre-point later" so that the telescope will be in the same place when reassembled.  The telescope stops should be used instead to prevent the telescope from slipping backward at higher elevations.
