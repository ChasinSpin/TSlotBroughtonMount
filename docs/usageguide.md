## Regular Deployment

A regular deployment is a deployment where the user pre-points the occultation for a particular event time and the star moves into view at the time of the occultation. This type of deployment may use a wooden square, paver, concrete pad, or other hard non-moving/settling surface to set up on.

It is recommended to carry a 5mm Allen Key for deployments incase something needs tightening.

Describe mount setup and adjustments.


## Pre-point Later

"Pre-point Later" deployments are set ups, where a platform (typically paver or staked plywood) is put in a location days in advance and the scope is pre-pointed to the location of the event. Then the telescope/mount are removed and brought back and deployed on the day of the event.  These set ups are more challenging, as the user has to be careful to restore everything to the exact same position.

The mount configuration is similar to the [Regular Deployment](#regular-deployment) detailed above, with the addition of steps to record the current telescope position and location on the platform.

## 12" Paver Deployment

Describe paver registration and foot reversal, also describe with and without feet.

## >=16" Paver Deployment (or Staked Plywood)

Same as 12" but without the foot reversal.
